## Test

Tests run automatically through GitHub Actions.
* Fast tests run on each push.
* Slow tests (decorated with `@pytest.mark.slow`) run on each PR.

You can also run tests manually with `pytest`:
```bash
pytest {{REPO_NAME}}

# For all tests, including slow ones:
pytest --slow {{REPO_NAME}}
```


## Release

[Optional] Requires either PyPI or Docker GHA workflows to be enabled.

Just tag a new release in this repo, and GHA will automatically publish Python wheels and/or Docker images.
