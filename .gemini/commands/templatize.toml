I want you to "templatize" a new Python repository (cloned from a GitHub repo template) by following these steps:

1. Run the `templatize` script:
    ```bash
    ./templatize
    ```
    This updates placeholders like `{{REPO_NAME}}`, so everything is configured with my username, repo name, email, etc.
2. Install the package, dev dependencies, and pre-commit hooks (see README).
3. Use `pip list` or `uv pip list` to very which package versions were installed, and pin them in `pyproject.toml` for consistency.  Do not add any new packages to `pyproject.toml` -- just pin the ones that are already listed.
4. Delete:
    - this section of the README on templatization
    - the `./templatize` script
    - the `Templatize` step in `.github/workflows/test.yaml`
    - the "templatize" slash-command file at `.gemini/commands/templatize.toml`
5. Commit and push the changes.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Templatize"
    git push
    ```
    Type checking, linting, and formatting will run automatically on commit.  You may fix any issues and recommit as needed.

Do not add any new files. Only modify or delete existing files.
